    # factor by which the game time should elapse per second. Also affects
    # mockup machine process durations. However, every single step will
    # take at least 1s (2s in case of the delvery station) to prevent
    # unobservable state changes.
    speedup: 4.0

    # Disable in case machine feedback from the slides is unavailable (e.g.,
    # if one ring station is unresponsive)
    #
    # Slide counters of ring stations listed here will increment the slide
    # counter whenever a payment is due.
    #
    # This also implicates for all listed machines that:
    #   1. Rings can be mounted without payment and the refbox awards additional
    #      points as if the payment was actually made
    #   2. Points for payments are only given, if they are used afterwards.
    #
    # To register a machine for this behavior, enter its full mane, e.g., to
    # add all ring stations simply use:
    # disable-base-payment-check: [C-RS1, C-RS2, M-RS1, M-RS2]
    disable-base-payment-check: [C-RS1, C-RS2, M-RS1, M-RS2]

    # synchronize refbox time with the time of a simulation
    time-sync:
      enable: false
      # estimate time by using the last given simulation time speed
      # (helps reducing the amount of messages to send)
